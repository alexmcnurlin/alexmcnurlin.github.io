    <strong>This is a work in progress!!</strong>

    This is my website, a reflection of me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of this site is to give me an outlet to practice my web design skills, and to act as a sort of resume to <a class="text-link">show</a> what I can do. There's not much here yet, but it will get better, I promise!
