title: "Targets"
description: "This was a program I wrote for my ENGR220 Dynamics class. The program simulates throwing a projectile at various trajectories and measuring it's distance to 5 targets. It then selects which trajectory is closest to all of the targets. The program determines what is the closes based on criteria defined by the professor"
