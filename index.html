    Welcome to my website! This website is to provide a little bit of information into who I am, and to act as a sort of portfolio to show of my skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn't much right now, but I will update it with more information over time!
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, you can check out my <a href="/resume/">resume</a>, and if you have any questions or comments, you can head over to the <a href="/contact/">contact page</a> to find out how to contact me!
