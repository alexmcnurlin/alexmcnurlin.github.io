  text:
    - I worked on a team of 5 engineering students to design and build a coin sorting machine.
    - We used a pair of Optical Interrupter to detect what type of coin was inserted into the machine.
    - When the type of coin was detected, it was sorted into 1 of 4 bins using a series of servos.
    - This project included prototyping, managing a budget, managing a deadline, and communicating with the team.

    - I feel like all calculator apps available for phones aren't as full-featured as they could be.
    - I'm working on an Android app in Java that would implement many of the features I feel other apps are lacking.
    - This also gives me a place to practice implementing algorithms for numerical computation.

- name: "Comparison of Programming Languages"
  type: "Numerical Linear Algebra class project"
  text:
    - "This project compared the runtimes of a few different programming languages using a few different numerical algorithms."
    - "Programming languages used included: C, C (with gcc optimization flags), Fortran, Fortran (with quadruple precision floating point numbers), Octave, Python, Python/Numpy."
    - "The following algorithms were used to compare runtimes: LU factorization, Cholesky factorization to solve the least squares problem, and QR factorization."
    - "Compiled languages (C and Fortran) ran much faster than the interpreted languages. Fortran with 128-bit precision ran about 8 times slower than Fortran with 64-bit precision. Python with Numpy often ran as fast as C, while Python without Numpy was often much slower."
    - "More details, as well as plots of the results, can be found below in the writeup for the project:
