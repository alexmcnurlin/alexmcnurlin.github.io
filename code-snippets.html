<h1>Did somebody say code?</h1> 

Since any good programmer has code snippets to show off, here's some snippets of code in various languages. These will include various things, namely school projects and FizzBuzz programs. 

{% for snippet in site.snippets %}
  <div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading {{ snippet.language | downcase }}">
      <h3 class="panel-title">{{ snippet.language }}: {{ snippet.title }}</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      {{ snippet.description }}
      </br>
      {{ snippet.content }}
    </div>
  </div>
{% endfor %}
